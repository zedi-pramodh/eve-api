  // The value is a 16-byte unsigned integer, representing the MTU size in bytes.
  // The minimum accepted value for the MTU is 1280 (RFC 8200, "IPv6 minimum link MTU").
  // If not defined (zero value), EVE will set the MTU to the default value of 1500 bytes.
  // On the host side, MTU is set to interfaces by EVE. On the guest (app) side,
  // the responsibility to set the MTU lies either with EVE or with the user/app, depending on
  // the network instance, app type and the type of interfaces used (local or switch,
  // VM or container, virtio or emulated).
  // For container applications running inside an EVE-created shim-VM, EVE initializes
  // the MTU of interfaces during shim-VM boot. Furthermore, interfaces connected
  // to local network instances will have their MTUs automatically updated if there is
  // a change in MTU configuration. To update the MTU of interfaces connected to switch
  // network instances, the user may run an external DHCP server in the network and publish
  // MTU changes via DHCP option 26 (the DHCP client run by EVE inside shim-VM will pick it up
  // and apply it).
  // In the case of VM applications, it is mostly the responsibility of the app/user to set
  // and keep the MTUs up-to-date.
  // If device provides HW-assisted virtualization capabilities, EVE will connect VM with
  // network instances using para-virtualized virtio interfaces, which allow to propagate MTU
  // value from the host to the guest. If the virtio driver used by the app supports the MTU
  // propagation (VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU feature flag is set), the initial MTU values will be set
  // using virtio (regardless of the network instance type).
  // To support MTU update for interfaces connected to local network instances, the app can
  // run a DHCP client and receive the latest MTU via DHCP option 26. For switch network
  // instances, the user can run his own external DHCP server in the network with the MTU
  // option configured.
  // Please note that application traffic leaving or entering the device via a network
  // adapter associated with the network instance is additionally limited by MTU values
  // of NI ports, configured within their NetworkConfig objects (refer to netconfig.proto).
  // If the configured network instance MTU is higher than MTU of any of the NI ports,
  // EVE will flag the network instance with an error and use the lowest MTU among
  // all the NI ports for the network instance instead. This is to prevent apps from sending
  // packets exceeding the path MTU. Packets entering NI via port with a higher MTU and with
  // size exceeding the NI MTU will get fragmented inside EVE (if allowed by IP header).
  // By default (if MTU is not configured by the user, i.e. 'mtu' is zero), EVE uses 1500
  // as MTU for air-gapped network instances and the lowest MTU among NI ports for NIs with
